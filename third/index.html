			<p><h1>The Gift of the Magi</h1>
			While the mistress of the home is gradually subsiding from the first stage to the second, take a look at the home. A furnished
				flat at $8 per week. It did not exactly beggar description, but it certainly had that word on the look-out for the mendicancy
				squad.
			</p>

			<p>

				In the vestibule below was a letter-box into which no letter would go, and an electric button from which no mortal finger
				could coax a ring. Also appertaining thereunto was a card bearing the name "Mr. James Dillingham Young."
			</p>
			<p>
				The "Dillingham" had been flung to the breeze during a former period of prosperity when its possessor was being paid $30
				per week. Now, when the income was shrunk to $20, the letters of "Dillingham" looked blurred, as though they were thinking
				seriously of contracting to a modest and unassuming D. But whenever Mr. James Dillingham Young came home and reached
				his flat above he was called "Jim" and greatly hugged by Mrs. James Dillingham Young, already introduced to you as Della.
				Which is all very good.
			</p>
			<p>
				Della finished her cry and attended to her cheeks with the powder rag. She stood by the window and looked out dully at a
				grey cat walking a grey fence in a grey backyard. To-morrow would be Christmas Day, and she had only $1.87 with which
				to buy Jim a present. She had been saving every penny she could for months, with this result. Twenty dollars a week doesn't
				go far. Expenses had been greater than she had calculated. They always are. Only $1.87 to buy a present for Jim. Her
				Jim. Many a happy hour she had spent planning for something nice for him. Something fine and rare and sterling--something
				just a little bit near to being worthy of the honour of being owned by Jim.
			</p>
			<p>
				There was a pier-glass between the windows of the room. Perhaps you have seen a pier-glass in an $8 Bat. A very thin and
				very agile person may, by observing his reflection in a rapid sequence of longitudinal strips, obtain a fairly accurate
				conception of his looks. Della, being slender, had mastered the art.
			</p>
			<p>
				Suddenly she whirled from the window and stood before the glass. Her eyes were shining brilliantly, but her face had lost
				its colour within twenty seconds. Rapidly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its full length.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now, there were two possessions of the James Dillingham Youngs in which they both took a mighty pride. One was Jim's gold
				watch that had been his father's and his grandfather's. The other was Della's hair. Had the Queen of Sheba lived in the
				flat across the airshaft, Della would have let her hair hang out of the window some day to dry just to depreciate Her
				Majesty's jewels and gifts. Had King Solomon been the janitor, with all his treasures piled up in the basement, Jim would
				have pulled out his watch every time he passed, just to see him pluck at his beard from envy.
			</p>
			<p>
				So now Della's beautiful hair fell about her, rippling and shining like a cascade of brown waters. It reached below her knee
				and made itself almost a garment for her. And then she did it up again nervously and quickly. Once she faltered for a
				minute and stood still while a tear or two splashed on the worn red carpet.
			</p>
			<p>
				On went her old brown jacket; on went her old brown hat. With a whirl of skirts and with the brilliant sparkle still in her
				eyes, she cluttered out of the door and down the stairs to the street.
			</p>
			<p>
				Where she stopped the sign read: "Mme Sofronie. Hair Goods of All Kinds." One Eight up Della ran, and collected herself,
				panting. Madame, large, too white, chilly, hardly looked the "Sofronie."
			</p>
			<p>
				"Will you buy my hair?" asked Della.
			</p>
			<p>
				"I buy hair," said Madame. "Take yer hat off and let's have a sight at the looks of it."
			</p>
			<p>
				Down rippled the brown cascade.
			</p>
			<p>
				"Twenty dollars," said Madame, lifting the mass with a practised hand.
			</p>
			<p>
				"Give it to me quick" said Della.
			</p>
			<p>
				Oh, and the next two hours tripped by on rosy wings. Forget the hashed metaphor. She was ransacking the stores for Jim's
				present.
			</p>
			<p>
				She found it at last. It surely had been made for Jim and no one else. There was no other like it in any of the stores, and
				she had turned all of them inside out. It was a platinum fob chain simple and chaste in design, properly proclaiming
				its value by substance alone and not by meretricious ornamentation--as all good things should do. It was even worthy
				of The Watch. As soon as she saw it she knew that it must be Jim's. It was like him. Quietness and value--the description
				applied to both. Twenty-one dollars they took from her for it, and she hurried home with the 78 cents. With that chain
				on his watch Jim might be properly anxious about the time in any company. Grand as the watch was, he sometimes looked
				at it on the sly on account of the old leather strap that he used in place of a chain.
			</p>
			<p>
				When Della reached home her intoxication gave way a little to prudence and reason. She got out her curling irons and lighted
				the gas and went to work repairing the ravages made by generosity added to love. Which is always a tremendous task dear
				friends--a mammoth task.
			</p>
			<p>
				Within forty minutes her head was covered with tiny, close-lying curls that made her look wonderfully like a truant schoolboy.
				She looked at her reflection in the mirror long, carefully, and critically.
			</p>

			<p>
				"If Jim doesn't kill me," she said to herself, "before he takes a second look at me, he'll say I look like a Coney Island
				chorus girl. But what could I do--oh! what could I do with a dollar and eighty-seven cents?"
			</p>
			<p>
				At 7 o'clock the coffee was made and the frying-pan was on the back of the stove hot and ready to cook the chops.
			</p>
			<p>
				Jim was never late. Della doubled the fob chain in her hand and sat on the corner of the table near the door that he always
				entered. Then she heard his step on the stair away down on the first flight, and she turned white for just a moment.
				She had a habit of saying little silent prayers about the simplest everyday things, and now she whispered: "Please, God,
				make him think I am still pretty."
			</p>
			<p>
				The door opened and Jim stepped in and closed it. He looked thin and very serious. Poor fellow, he was only twenty-two--and
				to be burdened with a family! He needed a new overcoat and he was with out gloves.
			</p>
			<p>
				Jim stepped inside the door, as immovable as a setter at the scent of quail. His eyes were fixed upon Della, and there was
				an expression in them that she could not read, and it terrified her. It was not anger, nor surprise, nor disapproval,
				nor horror, nor any of the sentiments that she had been prepared for. He simply stared at her fixedly with that peculiar
				expression on his face.
			</p>
			<p>
				Della wriggled off the table and went for him.
			</p>
			<p>
				"Jim, darling," she cried, "don't look at me that way. I had my hair cut off and sold it because I couldn't have lived through
				Christmas without giving you a present. It'll grow out again--you won't mind, will you? I just had to do it. My hair
				grows awfully fast. Say 'Merry Christmas!' Jim, and let's be happy. You don't know what a nice-what a beautiful, nice
				gift I've got for you."
			</p>
			<p>
				"You've cut off your hair?" asked Jim, laboriously, as if he had not arrived at that patent fact yet, even after the hardest
				mental labour.
			</p>
			<p>
				"Cut it off and sold it," said Della. "Don't you like me just as well, anyhow? I'm me without my hair, ain't I?"
			</p>
			<p>
				Jim looked about the room curiously.
			</p>
			<p>
				"You say your hair is gone?" he said, with an air almost of idiocy.
			</p>
			<p>
				"You needn't look for it," said Della. "It's sold, I tell you--sold and gone, too. It's Christmas Eve, boy. Be good to me,
				for it went for you. Maybe the hairs of my head were numbered," she went on with a sudden serious sweetness, "but nobody
				could ever count my love for you. Shall I put the chops on, Jim?"</p>
